# Medical Guidelines Reference Database
# Health Action Squad - Clinical Reference Standards
#
# PURPOSE: Establish evidence-based thresholds for health risk assessment
# APPROACH: Static YAML with quarterly manual review (transparency over automation)
#
# WHY YAML INSTEAD OF RAG/API?
# - Transparency: All thresholds traceable to medical sources
# - Cost: Zero runtime cost, no external dependencies
# - Reliability: Stable standards (guidelines change ~annually, not daily)
# - Auditability: Medical professionals can review and validate
# - Suitable for POC/MVP phase with standard health metrics
#
# MAINTENANCE: Quarterly review (90-day expiry enforced by CI/CD tests)
# LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-22
# NEXT REVIEW DUE: 2026-02-22
